Technotrix is a major player in the microchip and robotics industry seeking to improve sales and operational performance by unlocking the customer base potentials with focus on market expansion opportunities

The company essentially manufacture three products categories: Sensors, Robotics and Microchips to serve three customer sectors including Consumer Electronics, Automotive and the Industrial sector.

Geographical operations is in five countries namely; China, Japan, South Korea, Germany and the US covering Asia, Europe and North America respectively.

This project analysed the company’s sales, profitability, inventory and demand management for insights to business growth and expansion opportunities.

Despite making sales of over $250Million the company made just $53Million in profit.

Profit margin was just 21% against industry standard of 40% - 60%.

Performance variances are narrow across the parameters (i.e. products, sectors, and locations) with no clear leader.

Low sales in H1 of the year and plateaued at 2% above the H1 average in H2 safe for a one-off spike in April.

Sectoral ranking (by sales volume) revealed Consumer electronics at the top  of customer demands, then Automotive sector and the Industrial sector.
However, sales variances were marginal at just 2% of total sales figure.

In terms of products demands – Sensors and Robotics were close in sales volume above Microchips.

Geographical distribution of customers is even across the regions of operations: North-America, Europe and Asia.

Average profits across region, sector and products are flat with no clear leaders.

The potential to improve profits lies in lower production costs rather than sales volume.

Given the lowest production cost; Microchips produced in the US and South Korea can boost profit if allocated more resources in the Consumer Electronics and Industrial sectors.

Production efforts should be intensified in the 7-months period July through February (Q3 being the period with lowest cost).

**Products**:
Microchips holds the best potential for growth with lowest production cost-to-profit as well as the best profit margin performance (closest to the industry upper standard of 60%).

**Sector**:
The expansion efforts to increase sales on Microchips should be channeled through the Consumer Electronic and Industrial sectors to optimize the profit growth potential.

**Location**:
Review shows that the USA, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Singapore comes as the top 5 countries to site a Microchips factory based on favorable market conditions and infrastructure (Source: Gemini).

Expansion efforts can be focused on existing factories among this list of countries while new ones can be proposed as well.

However, factors like political stability and labour cost should be considered.

Not ruling out Africa, especially countries rich in the required minerals/materials.
