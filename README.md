Technotrix is a major player in the microchip and robotics industry seeking to improve sales and operational performance by unlocking the customer base potentials with focus on market expansion opportunities

The company essentially manufacture three products categories: Sensors, Robotics and Microchips to serve three customer sectors including Consumer Electronics, Automotive and the Industrial sector.

Geographical operations is in five countries namely; China, Japan, South Korea, Germany and the US covering Asia, Europe and North America respectively.

This project analysed the company’s sales, profitability, inventory and demand management for insights to business growth and expansion opportunities.

Despite making sales of over $250Million the company made just $53Million in profit.

Profit margin was just 21% against industry standard of 40% - 60%.

Performance variances are narrow across the parameters (i.e. products, sectors, and locations) with no clear leader.

Low sales in H1 of the year and plateaued at 2% above the H1 average in H2 safe for a one-off spike in April.

Sectoral ranking (by sales volume) revealed Consumer electronics at the top  of customer demands, then Automotive sector and the Industrial sector.
However, sales variances were marginal at just 2% of total sales figure.

In terms of products demands – Sensors and Robotics were close in sales volume above Microchips.

Geographical distribution of customers is even across the regions of operations: North-America, Europe and Asia.

Average profits across region, sector and products are flat with no clear leaders.

The potential to improve profits lies in lower production costs rather than sales volume.

Given the lowest production cost; Microchips produced in the US and South Korea can boost profit if allocated more resources in the Consumer Electronics and Industrial sectors.

Production efforts should be intensified in the 7-months period July through February (Q3 being the period with lowest cost).

**A. Improved Profitability**

To improve profitability, Technotrix should focus on leveraging its lowest production costs.

**•	Strategic Production Allocation**: Intensify the production of Microchips in the US and South Korea, as this combination offers the lowest production costs.

**•	Targeted Sales Efforts**: Allocate more resources to sell the low-cost Microchips in the Consumer Electronics and Industrial sectors, identified as key areas for growth.


**B. Inventory Management and Cost Efficiencies**

The analysis showed that profitability is tied more to cost reduction than to sales volume.

**•	Reduce Production Costs**: The company should focus on lowering production costs to increase the profit margin from the current 21% to the industry standard of 40%-60%.

**•	Inventory Optimization**: Align production schedules with the identified low-cost periods (July through February). This ensures that inventory is built when it's most cost-effective.

**•	Minimize H1 Production**: Production should be minimized in the first half of the year due to lower sales and higher costs, helping to avoid excess inventory and associated holding costs.


**C. Market Expansion Opportunities**

The current market performance is relatively flat across all products, sectors, and geographical regions.

**•	Targeted Sector Expansion**: Focus on the Consumer Electronics and Industrial sectors for market expansion, as they have shown the highest demand for the company's products.

**•	Product Specialization**: Given the high demand, Sensors and Robotics are prime candidates for focused market expansion efforts. The company can also use the low-cost Microchips as a strategic entry point into new markets or to gain a competitive edge.

**•	Regional Focus**: Leverage the cost advantages of US and South Korean production to expand into new markets or increase market share in existing ones.

**•	Locations Research**: Further research shows that the USA, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and Singapore comes as the top five countries to site a Microchips factory based on favorable market conditions and infrastructure (Source: Gemini). However, factors like political stability and labour cost should be considered, not ruling out Africa, especially countries rich in deposit of the required minerals/materials.
